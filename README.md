# Mapping-Earthquakes

Creating interactive maps using Leaflet.js library, Javascript, and HTML to retrieve earthquake information from a GeoJSON file and plot the results in a visual format.

# Project Overview

This project is to build an interactive map by using earthquake GeoJSON data. we will map all the recored earthquake in the past 7 days and the size of circle marker of the earthquake is depending on its magnitude.we also map the earthquake with its magnitude is greater than 4.5.

On the map, we added 3 base layers which are "streets", "satellite streets" and "dark", these layers could be viewed by the user clicking on different option on the top right corner.

Throughout this project, we learned how to create map layers, visual customizations that included:

-Toggling between map styles (i.e. dark, streets, satellite)

-Color changes to lines, marker types, and sizes

-Adding popup info box

-Plotting different points, multiple points, lines, polygons

# Resources

-Data: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0

-Software: VS code, D3, JavaScript, Leaflet

# Results

After adding three base layers and three data sets, the webpage looks like the following:

All earthquake happened in the past 7 days:
